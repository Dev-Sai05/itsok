CR - 25030013 has been raised To fix the response time in the E1MRService.

Code modifications are done in CR - 25030013

Log db initial save and update logdb code has been removed

Branch and teller validations has been removed

Framework aggregator removed and cpu memory configurations increased for high throughput.

Due to techops approval and service made in java CR 25030013 has been cancelled.





If New CR raised to initiate the E1MRService Again below points need to handle.

Service should work for 24h Region Mode (Day, Night, Ref, Log).

Respoonse time has to be in milliseconds need to handle in Cobol.

If E1MRService will use in production continously with heavy load, DBIO and Cobol cannot handle Multithreading, High Requests.

Refactoring of Cobol Components has to be done. same CBS codes cannot be used in visual cobol microservice due to response and architecture issues.

Memory and CPU consumptions has to take care.

Pods and DB Connections has to be finalized 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CR 25030013 was raised to address response time issues in the E1MRService.

As part of CR 25030013, the following changes were implemented:

Removed initial save and update logic for Log DB

Removed branch and teller validations

Removed framework aggregator

Increased CPU and memory configurations to support high throughput

However, based on TechOps approval and the strategic decision to implement the service in Java, CR 25030013 has been cancelled.

If a new CR is raised to re-initiate E1MRService using Visual COBOL microservices, the following points must be addressed mandatorily:

1. 24x7 Region Mode Support

Service must work seamlessly across Day, Night, Ref, and Log regions

Region switching logic should be validated under load and failover scenarios

2. Response Time Constraints

Response time must be in milliseconds

COBOL-based processing needs optimization at:

File access

DBIO calls

Data movement and copybook handling

3. Multithreading & Concurrency Limitations

DBIO and native COBOL do not support multithreading

Visual COBOL services cannot efficiently handle:

High concurrency

Burst traffic

This creates a scalability bottleneck in microservice architecture

4. COBOL Component Refactoring

Existing CBS COBOL programs cannot be reused directly

Significant refactoring is required due to:

Monolithic design

Synchronous processing model

Shared resource usage

Same CBS code base is not suitable for low-latency microservices

5. Connection & Resource Contention Risks

Shared DB connections can cause:

Thread blocking

Long wait times

Transaction failures under load

Connection lifecycle management becomes critical in Visual COBOL services

6. Memory & CPU Consumption

Visual COBOL services have higher:

Memory footprint

CPU usage compared to Java-based services

Improper sizing can lead to:

Pod restarts

OOM errors

Performance degradation

7. Pod Sizing & DB Pool Finalization

Number of pods and DB connections must be finalized upfront

Over-scaling pods will not improve throughput due to COBOL limitations

DB pool exhaustion is a high-risk area

8. Observability & Debugging Challenges

Limited support for:

Distributed tracing

Fine-grained performance metrics

Root cause analysis becomes difficult under production load

9. High Availability & Failover Considerations

COBOL services need careful handling for:

Session/state management

Restart and recovery scenarios

Stateless design is difficult to enforce with existing COBOL components

10. Long-Term Maintainability Risk

Any future enhancements or performance tuning will be complex

Dependency on legacy COBOL limits flexibility compared to Java microservices

Considering the above constraints, these aspects must be thoroughly evaluated before proceeding with a new CR for E1MRService using Visual COBOL microservices, to avoid scalability, performance, and operational risks in production.
